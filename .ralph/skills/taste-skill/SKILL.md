## 0. DESIGN FROM INTENT, NOT FROM PATTERNS

AI models default to treating design as retrieval — "what have I seen that looks like this?" Great design is judgment — "what does this specific context demand, and what's the most precise way to express it?" Retrieval gives you competent. Judgment gives you memorable. Every prompt you receive carries embedded patterns from training data. Accepting them uncritically means designing inside those patterns. Your job is to break out of them using the PRD as your anchor.

Before writing any code for this story, read the PRD. Understand who the user is, what they are feeling in this moment, and what the product needs them to feel next. Every design decision must be traceable to something in the PRD — if you cannot trace it, it is a default choice, and default choices produce generic design.

**The process:**

1. **Identify the user's context for this screen.** What emotional state are they in? What cognitive mode — scanning, reflecting, comparing, composing? What is the physical context — leaning in with focus, glancing quickly, on mobile? What did the user just experience, and where do they go next? The PRD describes this. Find it.

2. **Derive design constraints from that context.** These are not pre-defined — they emerge from reading the PRD for this specific screen. Examples:
   - PRD says the user is reflecting deeply → constraint: one focal point, generous space, no distractions, motion should breathe not bounce
   - PRD says the user is scanning a dashboard → constraint: information hierarchy must be readable in 3 seconds, dense but not cluttered
   - PRD says this is a reveal moment → constraint: progressive disclosure, build anticipation, the design should reward the user for the effort they put in
   - PRD says the user is in a vulnerable state → constraint: warm typography, no rush signals, the interface should feel like it is thinking with the user

3. **Choose the design principles that serve these constraints.** Constraints say what the user needs. Principles say how to express it. Choose from principles like: information density over whitespace, tension through asymmetry, typography as the primary expressive element, progressive disclosure over upfront complexity, motion as emotional pacing. Principles generate original design. Style references generate copies.

4. **Name the obvious solution and reject it.** Before committing to a direction, articulate what the default AI-generated version of this screen would look like. What layout, typography, spacing, and motion would a generic implementation produce? That is the floor you must exceed. Design is search — the first solution that comes to mind is almost never the best one. Explore before you commit.

5. **Identify the brave choices.** Every screen needs one or two decisions that make this design *this* design and not any design. What is the surprising choice within the constraints — the thing that a competent designer wouldn't do but a great designer would? If every choice is the safe choice, the output is forgettable. The constraints from step 2 define the boundaries. The brave choices define the character.

6. **Build against constraints, principles, and brave choices.** Use the technical rules in the sections below, but let the constraints decide which rules matter most for this screen. The dials (DESIGN_VARIANCE, MOTION_INTENSITY, VISUAL_DENSITY) should serve the user's context, not the other way around.

7. **Self-evaluate in context, not in isolation.** Before finishing, walk through the screen as the user would experience it — arriving from the previous screen, in the emotional state the PRD describes, needing to transition to the next screen. Does the design serve that journey, or does it only look good as a standalone screenshot? Then ask: if you showed this to a senior designer at a studio you respect, what would they change first? If the answer is "the whole approach" — re-read the PRD. If the answer is "nothing, but it's predictable" — you haven't made brave enough choices.

**The rule:** If you find yourself making the same design that any AI would make for this type of screen, stop. Re-read the PRD. The PRD constrains design so tightly that generic output should feel wrong.

## 1. ACTIVE BASELINE CONFIGURATION
* DESIGN_VARIANCE: 8 (1=Perfect Symmetry, 10=Artsy Chaos)
* MOTION_INTENSITY: 6 (1=Static/No movement, 10=Cinematic/Magic Physics)
* VISUAL_DENSITY: 4 (1=Art Gallery/Airy, 10=Pilot Cockpit/Packed Data)

**AI Instruction:** The standard baseline for all generations is strictly set to these values (8, 6, 4). Do not ask the user to edit this file. Otherwise, ALWAYS listen to the user: adapt these values dynamically based on what they explicitly request in their chat prompts. Use these baseline (or user-overridden) values as your global variables to drive the specific logic in Sections 3 through 7.

## 2. DEFAULT ARCHITECTURE & CONVENTIONS
Unless the user explicitly specifies a different stack, adhere to these structural constraints to maintain consistency:

* **DEPENDENCY VERIFICATION [MANDATORY]:** Before importing ANY 3rd party library (e.g. `framer-motion`, `lucide-react`, `zustand`), you MUST check `package.json`. If the package is missing, you MUST output the installation command (e.g. `npm install package-name`) before providing the code. **Never** assume a library exists.
* **Framework & Interactivity:** React or Next.js. Default to Server Components (`RSC`). 
    * **RSC SAFETY:** Global state works ONLY in Client Components. In Next.js, wrap providers in a `"use client"` component.
    * **INTERACTIVITY ISOLATION:** If Sections 4 or 7 (Motion/Liquid Glass) are active, the specific interactive UI component MUST be extracted as an isolated leaf component with `'use client'` at the very top. Server Components must exclusively render static layouts.
* **State Management:** Use local `useState`/`useReducer` for isolated UI. Use global state strictly for deep prop-drilling avoidance.
* **Styling Policy:** Use Tailwind CSS (v3/v4) for 90% of styling. 
    * **TAILWIND VERSION LOCK:** Check `package.json` first. Do not use v4 syntax in v3 projects. 
    * **T4 CONFIG GUARD:** For v4, do NOT use `tailwindcss` plugin in `postcss.config.js`. Use `@tailwindcss/postcss` or the Vite plugin.
* **ANTI-EMOJI POLICY [CRITICAL]:** NEVER use emojis in code, markup, text content, or alt text. Replace symbols with high-quality icons (Radix, Phosphor) or clean SVG primitives. Emojis are BANNED.
* **Responsiveness & Spacing:**
  * Standardize breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`).
  * Contain page layouts using `max-w-[1400px] mx-auto` or `max-w-7xl`.
  * **Viewport Stability [CRITICAL]:** NEVER use `h-screen` for full-height Hero sections. ALWAYS use `min-h-[100dvh]` to prevent catastrophic layout jumping on mobile browsers (iOS Safari).
  * **Grid over Flex-Math:** NEVER use complex flexbox percentage math (`w-[calc(33%-1rem)]`). ALWAYS use CSS Grid (`grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6`) for reliable structures.
* **Icons:** You MUST use exactly `@phosphor-icons/react` or `@radix-ui/react-icons` as the import paths (check installed version). Standardize `strokeWidth` globally (e.g., exclusively use `1.5` or `2.0`).


## 3. DESIGN ENGINEERING DIRECTIVES (Bias Correction)
LLMs have statistical biases toward specific UI cliché patterns. Proactively construct premium interfaces using these engineered rules:

**Rule 1: Deterministic Typography**
* **Display/Headlines:** Default to `text-4xl md:text-6xl tracking-tighter leading-none`.
    * **ANTI-SLOP:** Discourage `Inter` for "Premium" or "Creative" vibes. Force unique character using `Geist`, `Outfit`, `Cabinet Grotesk`, or `Satoshi`.
    * **TECHNICAL UI RULE:** Serif fonts are strictly BANNED for Dashboard/Software UIs. For these contexts, use exclusively high-end Sans-Serif pairings (`Geist` + `Geist Mono` or `Satoshi` + `JetBrains Mono`).
* **Body/Paragraphs:** Default to `text-base text-gray-600 leading-relaxed max-w-[65ch]`.

**Rule 2: Color Calibration**
* **Constraint:** Max 1 Accent Color. Saturation < 80%.
* **THE LILA BAN:** The "AI Purple/Blue" aesthetic is strictly BANNED. No purple button glows, no neon gradients. Use absolute neutral bases (Zinc/Slate) with high-contrast, singular accents (e.g. Emerald, Electric Blue, or Deep Rose).
* **COLOR CONSISTENCY:** Stick to one palette for the entire output. Do not fluctuate between warm and cool grays within the same project.

**Rule 3: Layout Diversification**
* **ANTI-CENTER BIAS:** Centered Hero/H1 sections are strictly BANNED when `LAYOUT_VARIANCE > 4`. Force "Split Screen" (50/50), "Left Aligned content/Right Aligned asset", or "Asymmetric White-space" structures.

**Rule 4: Materiality, Shadows, and "Anti-Card Overuse"**
* **DASHBOARD HARDENING:** For `VISUAL_DENSITY > 7`, generic card containers are strictly BANNED. Use logic-grouping via `border-t`, `divide-y`, or purely negative space. Data metrics should breathe without being boxed in unless elevation (z-index) is functionally required.
* **Execution:** Use cards ONLY when elevation communicates hierarchy. When a shadow is used, tint it to the background hue.

**Rule 5: Interactive UI States**
* **Mandatory Generation:** LLMs naturally generate "static" successful states. You MUST implement full interaction cycles:
  * **Loading:** Skeletal loaders matching layout sizes (avoid generic circular spinners).
  * **Empty States:** Beautifully composed empty states indicating how to populate data.
  * **Error States:** Clear, inline error reporting (e.g., forms).
  * **Tactile Feedback:** On `:active`, use `-translate-y-[1px]` or `scale-[0.98]` to simulate a physical push indicating success/action.

**Rule 6: Data & Form Patterns**
* **Forms:** Label MUST sit above input. Helper text is optional but should exist in markup. Error text below input. Use a standard `gap-2` for input blocks.

## 4. CREATIVE PROACTIVITY (Anti-Slop Implementation)
To actively combat generic AI designs, systematically implement these high-end coding concepts as your baseline:
* **"Liquid Glass" Refraction:** When glassmorphism is needed, go beyond `backdrop-blur`. Add a 1px inner border (`border-white/10`) and a subtle inner shadow (`shadow-[inset_0_1px_0_rgba(255,255,255,0.1)]`) to simulate physical edge refraction.
* **Magnetic Micro-physics (If MOTION_INTENSITY > 5):** Implement buttons that pull slightly toward the mouse cursor. **CRITICAL:** NEVER use React `useState` for magnetic hover or continuous animations. Use EXCLUSIVELY Framer Motion's `useMotionValue` and `useTransform` outside the React render cycle to prevent performance collapse on mobile.
* **Perpetual Micro-Interactions:** When `MOTION_INTENSITY > 5`, embed continuous, infinite micro-animations (Pulse, Typewriter, Float, Shimmer, Carousel) in standard components (avatars, status dots, backgrounds). Apply premium Spring Physics (`type: "spring", stiffness: 100, damping: 20`) to all interactive elements—no linear easing.
* **Layout Transitions:** Always utilize Framer Motion's `layout` and `layoutId` props for smooth re-ordering, resizing, and shared element transitions across state changes.
* **Staggered Orchestration:** Do not mount lists or grids instantly. Use `staggerChildren` (Framer) or CSS cascade (`animation-delay: calc(var(--index) * 100ms)`) to create sequential waterfall reveals. **CRITICAL:** For `staggerChildren`, the Parent (`variants`) and Children MUST reside in the identical Client Component tree. If data is fetched asynchronously, pass the data as props into a centralized Parent Motion wrapper.

## 5. PERFORMANCE GUARDRAILS
* **DOM Cost:** Apply grain/noise filters exclusively to fixed, pointer-event-none pseudo-elements (e.g., `fixed inset-0 z-50 pointer-events-none`) and NEVER to scrolling containers to prevent continuous GPU repaints and mobile performance degradation.
* **Hardware Acceleration:** Never animate `top`, `left`, `width`, or `height`. Animate exclusively via `transform` and `opacity`.
* **Z-Index Restraint:** NEVER spam arbitrary `z-50` or `z-10` unprompted. Use z-indexes strictly for systemic layer contexts (Sticky Navbars, Modals, Overlays).

## 6. TECHNICAL REFERENCE (Dial Definitions)

### DESIGN_VARIANCE (Level 1-10)
* **1-3 (Predictable):** Flexbox `justify-center`, strict 12-column symmetrical grids, equal paddings.
* **4-7 (Offset):** Use `margin-top: -2rem` overlapping, varied image aspect ratios (e.g., 4:3 next to 16:9), left-aligned headers over center-aligned data.
* **8-10 (Asymmetric):** Masonry layouts, CSS Grid with fractional units (e.g., `grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr`), massive empty zones (`padding-left: 20vw`). 
* **MOBILE OVERRIDE:** For levels 4-10, any asymmetric layout above `md:` MUST aggressively fall back to a strict, single-column layout (`w-full`, `px-4`, `py-8`) on viewports `< 768px` to prevent horizontal scrolling and layout breakage.

### MOTION_INTENSITY (Level 1-10)
* **1-3 (Static):** No automatic animations. CSS `:hover` and `:active` states only.
* **4-7 (Fluid CSS):** Use `transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`. Use `animation-delay` cascades for load-ins. Focus strictly on `transform` and `opacity`. Use `will-change: transform` sparingly.
* **8-10 (Advanced Choreography):** Complex scroll-triggered reveals or parallax. Use Framer Motion hooks. NEVER use `window.addEventListener('scroll')`.

### VISUAL_DENSITY (Level 1-10)
* **1-3 (Art Gallery Mode):** Lots of white space. Huge section gaps. Everything feels very expensive and clean.
* **4-7 (Daily App Mode):** Normal spacing for standard web apps.
* **8-10 (Cockpit Mode):** Tiny paddings. No card boxes; just 1px lines to separate data. Everything is packed. **Mandatory:** Use Monospace (`font-mono`) for all numbers.

## 7. AI TELLS (Forbidden Patterns)
To guarantee a premium, non-generic output, you MUST strictly avoid these common AI design signatures unless explicitly requested:

### Visual & CSS
* **NO Neon/Outer Glows:** Do not use default `box-shadow` glows or auto-glows. Use inner borders or subtle tinted shadows.
* **NO Pure Black:** Never use `#000000`. Use Off-Black, Zinc-950, or Charcoal.
* **NO Oversaturated Accents:** Desaturate accents to blend elegantly with neutrals.
* **NO Excessive Gradient Text:** Do not use text-fill gradients for large headers.
* **NO Custom Mouse Cursors:** They are outdated and ruin performance/accessibility.

### Typography
* **NO Inter Font:** Banned. Use `Geist`, `Outfit`, `Cabinet Grotesk`, or `Satoshi`.
* **NO Oversized H1s:** The first heading should not scream. Control hierarchy with weight and color, not just massive scale.
* **Serif Constraints:** Use Serif fonts ONLY for creative/editorial designs. **NEVER** use Serif on clean Dashboards.

### Layout & Spacing
* **Align & Space Perfectly:** Ensure padding and margins are mathematically perfect. Avoid floating elements with awkward gaps.
* **NO 3-Column Card Layouts:** The generic "3 equal cards horizontally" feature row is BANNED. Use a 2-column Zig-Zag, asymmetric grid, or horizontal scrolling approach instead.

### Content & Data (The "Jane Doe" Effect)
* **NO Generic Names:** "John Doe", "Sarah Chan", or "Jack Su" are banned. Use highly creative, realistic-sounding names.
* **NO Generic Avatars:** DO NOT use standard SVG "egg" or Lucide user icons for avatars. Use creative, believable photo placeholders or specific styling.
* **NO Fake Numbers:** Avoid predictable outputs like `99.99%`, `50%`, or basic phone numbers (`1234567`). Use organic, messy data (`47.2%`, `+1 (312) 847-1928`).
* **NO Startup Slop Names:** "Acme", "Nexus", "SmartFlow". Invent premium, contextual brand names.
* **NO Filler Words:** Avoid AI copywriting clichés like "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", or "Next-Gen". Use concrete verbs.

## 8. POST-BUILD EVALUATION MODE

After building a design story, use this section to evaluate what you built. This is not optional for design stories — the Ralph harness uses your evaluation to update the knowledge graph.

**Walkthrough evaluation:**
Walk through the screen you just built as the user would experience it. Use the PRD's emotional arc as your rubric:
1. What emotional state is the user in when they arrive at this screen?
2. What should they feel when they leave?
3. Does the implementation actually produce that emotional transition, or does it just display the right content?

**Gap identification — compare against these dimensions:**
- **Pacing:** Does the timing of transitions, reveals, and loading states match the emotional weight the PRD describes? A reveal that the PRD calls "unwrapping something" should not feel like a page load.
- **Hierarchy:** Does the visual hierarchy guide attention to what the PRD says matters most? If the PRD says "What makes you *you*" is the emotional peak, is it visually the most prominent element?
- **Earned quality:** Does the output reward the effort the user put in? A synthesis reveal after 10 minutes of reflection should feel different from a search result.
- **Brave choices:** Did you make at least one choice that a generic AI implementation would not have made? If the screen looks like what any competent model would produce, the design hasn't earned its place.

**What to report:**
Name the single biggest gap between what the PRD intends for the user experience and what the implementation delivers. The bar for "biggest" is: if you showed a user the product before and after fixing this gap, would they say "that's noticeably better" or would they shrug? Only report gaps that clear the "noticeably better" bar. Be specific: "the reveal cards appear at uniform 600ms intervals — the PRD says the AHA section should have extra anticipation but the timing doesn't build" is useful. "Could be better" is not.

If no gap clears the "noticeably better" bar, say so honestly and explain why the implementation achieves the PRD's experiential intent — what specific choices make it work. This is valuable signal too. Not every screen needs fixing.

### External Resources & Components
* **NO Broken Unsplash Links:** Do not use Unsplash. Use absolute, reliable placeholders like `https://picsum.photos/seed/{random_string}/800/600` or SVG UI Avatars.
* **shadcn/ui Customization:** You may use `shadcn/ui`, but NEVER in its generic default state. You MUST customize the radii, colors, and shadows to match the high-end project aesthetic.
* **Production-Ready Cleanliness:** Code must be extremely clean, visually striking, memorable, and meticulously refined in every detail.

## 8. TECHNICAL MOTION REFERENCE
When appropriate, leverage **GSAP (ScrollTrigger/Parallax)** for complex scrolltelling or **ThreeJS/WebGL** for 3D/Canvas animations, rather than basic CSS motion. **CRITICAL:** Never mix GSAP/ThreeJS with Framer Motion in the same component tree. Default to Framer Motion for UI/Bento interactions. Use GSAP/ThreeJS EXCLUSIVELY for isolated full-page scrolltelling or canvas backgrounds, wrapped in strict useEffect cleanup blocks.

## 9. MOTION PHILOSOPHY
Motion should serve the user's emotional context, not demonstrate technical capability. Before adding any animation, ask: does this motion match how the user feels in this moment?

* **Spring Physics:** No linear easing. Use `type: "spring", stiffness: 100, damping: 20` for a premium, weighty feel.
* **Layout Transitions:** Utilize Framer Motion's `layout` and `layoutId` props for smooth re-ordering, resizing, and shared element state transitions.
* **Performance:** Wrap dynamic lists in `<AnimatePresence>` and optimize for 60fps. **PERFORMANCE CRITICAL:** Any perpetual motion or infinite loop MUST be memoized (React.memo) and completely isolated in its own microscopic Client Component. Never trigger re-renders in the parent layout.
* **Pacing:** Fast motion communicates efficiency. Slow motion communicates weight and importance. Breathing motion communicates calm. Choose based on the user's context from the PRD, not based on what looks impressive.

## 10. FINAL PRE-FLIGHT CHECK
Evaluate your code against this matrix before outputting. This is the **last** filter you apply to your logic.
- [ ] Can you trace every major design decision to something in the PRD?
- [ ] Is global state used appropriately to avoid deep prop-drilling rather than arbitrarily?
- [ ] Is mobile layout collapse (`w-full`, `px-4`, `max-w-7xl mx-auto`) guaranteed for high-variance designs?
- [ ] Do full-height sections safely use `min-h-[100dvh]` instead of the bugged `h-screen`?
- [ ] Do `useEffect` animations contain strict cleanup functions?
- [ ] Are empty, loading, and error states provided?
- [ ] Are cards omitted in favor of spacing where possible?
- [ ] Did you strictly isolate CPU-heavy perpetual animations in their own Client Components?
